C'est idéal pour une famille de 3 ou 4 personnes.<br/>Petits soucis en arrivant il y avait personne pour nous recevoir, et il manquait le savon pour la douche, le liquide vaisselle, nous les avons reçu de surlendemain. Il y a aussi le bruit du Métro de NY, donc une première nuit difficile si on est pas habitué. Jennifer est correcte le remboursement de la caution était très rapide.  A part ces petits détails notre court séjour c'est bien passé. <br/>Si j'ai la possibilité de revenir sur NY pour les vacances, je reprendrai à ""The Midtown Castle""<br/>Jean<br/>Possession - Ile de La Réunion<br/>",5,2009-11-21

2595,r:117113,We had a wonderful stay at Jennifer's charming apartment! They were very organized and helpful; I would definitely recommend staying at the Midtown Castle!,5,2010-05-25
2595,r:1783688,"Hi to everyone!<br/>Would say our greatest compliments to Jennifer, the host of Midtown Castle. We spent in this lovely apartment in the heart of Manhattan one month (April, 2012) and will remember this time as ours best.<br/>The apartment is pretty spacious and great located - the 5-th Ave right around the corner. There is everything you can need during your short or long stay. Jennifer is very friendly, vigorous and very responsible host. Thanks her and highly recomend this apartment for everyone who are looking for a quiet place right in the center of the boiling Midtown!",5,2012-05-07
2595,r:1870771,"Jennifer was very friendly and helpful, and her place is exactly as advertised. The location is very convenient, and it was a pleasure to stay at the Midtown Castle. I definitely recommend it :)<br/><br/>Thanks !",5,2012-05-17
2595,r:2124102,"This apartment is like a real castle old and unique. The age- related stains on the bathroom floor and dark discolorations in the carpet too indeed indicate that the building was built a long, long time ago. <br/>We weren’t happy with the way the apartment was cleaned. Jennifer, the host sent in a cleaning lady right the next morning and therefore did everything she thought was appropriate to make our stay comfortable. She let us know that guest satisfaction is important to her.   <br/>After we found out that the key for the main entrance was missing by locking ourselves out in the middle of the night she was so kind to bring us the missing key within an hour. <br/>We had to leave the apartment a few days earlier because we suffered from an allergic reaction (which has never happened before and never after) related to the air conditioner as our doctor told us. <br/>The apartment is located in a great area! Subway stations are just two minutes away! The area seems quite safe although there are “special” adult video stores located in the same street nearby.  <br/>A deli/grocery store is next to the building, a 24 hours open pharmacy is across the end of the street! <br/>",5,2012-08-18
2595,r:496053,"Jennifer's place was in a great midtown location, close to the subway, Bryant Park and Times Square.  She met us after midnight to give us keys to the place, which we appreciated.<br/><br/>The apartment is spacious for two people; a deli next door is perfect for last minute toiletries.<br/><br/>Thanks for allowing us to stay!",5,2013-05-20

2595,r:16584002,"We hebben genoten van ons verblijf in het appartement van Jennifer. Prima en centraal gelegen, ook t.o.v. openbaar vervoer. Het daklicht maakt dat het prettig licht is en ruim aanvoelt. Enige minpuntje is de vier trappen. ",5,2014-10-18
2595,r:27436102,"Jennifer was very good at communicating with us prior to our arrival. Although she could not meet with us herself, she had a friend meet with us to give us the keys and more information when we arrived. She was also very accommodating with our flight schedule and check out. <br/><br/>The apartment was great overall, although just a little smaller than we expected from the pictures. Our favorite part was of course the skylight and dart board she had hanging. The apartment was in clean condition when we arrived, which is always a good thing!<br/><br/>The location was amazing, close to everything, a great place to stay for our first visit to New York.  It is on the top floor, so we definitely got our workout in going up and down those stairs each day! <br/><br/>We had a blast! <br/><br/>Thanks Jennifer! <br/>",5,2015-03-30

2595,r:18636130,"Jennifer was without doubt an amazing host, she was incredibly kind and welcoming and made sure we had a great weekend. She supplied books and notes with all sorts of information about NY, the flat and the area. The flat is in the perfect location, not more than a 10 minute walk from Times Square and about the same distance from Penn station. The apartment itself is just as described, great for one or two people. I highly recommend the apartment and will surely use it again next time I'm in NY!",5,2015-09-28
2595,r:16512817,"Jennifer was an unbelievable host! Great communication and made sure I was all set for my big weekend with my college age daughter.<br/><br/>I love all parts of NYC, but if you want Midtown, this is just about perfect. The place is sunny and bright and surpisingly little noise from the street on Friday and Saturday night. Plus, we felt very safe.<br/><br/>Size wise, 1-2 people is probably perfect. Any more may feel a little cramped.<br/><br/>Lastly, most Airnb places I stay feel liked they have been furnished by a recent college grad. It's clear that Jennifer lives here and was so accomodating opening up her home to us.",5,2016-04-11
2595,r:134977148,"The Midtown Castle was a great choice for our weekend stay. It is centrally located, and walking distance for most of our stops. The apartment was clean, nicely decorated, and the perfect size for our trip. Jennifer was a great host, and made our self check-in very easy!

2595,r:28067322,"Jennifer was super friendly and helpful. Great host with an amazing studio apartment right in the middle of NYC. Everything is walking distance! The Empire State Building, Times Square, and New York library were all around the corner or less than 15 minutes walk. Best location ever and great relaxing place to stay.<br/>Quick note: Apartment is located on the 4th floor with no elevator so make sure you don’t have very heavy luggage. In any case it’s a good workout :)",5,2017-10-29
2595,r:18840128,"Jennifer's space was such a lovely experience. PreCheckin and checkin was detailed and seamless, she made it easier on us and answered all questions so quickly. The space itself is such a unique, clear & zen energy- we loved it. Not to mention it was very clean & close to everything! Definitely be prepared for the 4flight workout (we appreciated that)! We enjoyed the space and location & would recommend this to anyone coming to explore the city!!",5,2017-11-04
2595,r:2888785,"This is a nice apartment and it looks like in the photo. It is well located and Jennifer was very nice and super responsive! She also let me have a late check out at no extra cost, which was very kind of her. 5 stars for that! On the negative side, it was rather cold in the room. I stayed there for 6 nights end of November, beginning of December so the central heating should be on, but it only worked occasionally (this is a building from 1890 and the amenities are a bit worn and probably never have been updated). There is an extra heater but it is not sufficient to heat up the room cause the ceiling is high and the glas roof is not a good insulation. Consequently for the majority of the time the temperature inside was between 64-68F (17-20 C) which was disagreeable. Second point was the noise from 3 construction sites in the street, one just opposite the building. They started work early and the clearing of rubble was sometimes done past midnight and very loud. Once the heating problem is sorted out and the construction is done it will be a nice place to stay.",5,2017-12-03
2595,r:2548115,Beautiful and stylish spot in a very unique building! Jennifer is a wonderful host and was kind enough to meet us for out late-night check-in. We loved the apartment!,5,2017-12-10

2595,r:128182033,"We really enjoyed our stay at Jennifer’s apartment. She was very hospitable and answered any questions we had promptly. The hike up the four flights of stairs with the luggage was a challenge. <br/>The location was amazing. Central to everything, 5 min walk to the subway, close to time square. There was a bit of noise at night from all the construction happening around the apartment but Jennifer supplied us with ear plugs which worked a treat. Would highly recommend her apartment",5,2018-04-29
2595,r:11496712,This apartment is convenient and functional.  The huge skylight makes it feel open and airy. And it is located smack dab in the middle of Manhattan.  Highly recommended.,5,2018-05-18
2595,r:76998885,The Midtown Castle is a beautiful place to stay in the center of the city.  Truly a sanctuary with everything you need. Little touches of nature and beauty throughout. Waking up with the sun from the skylight was amazing. ,5,2018-05-27
2595,r:115721479,Jennifer is very nice and responsive. The location of the apt is great. However <br/>- the bed was small and smelly. The apt also smelled weird. We had to sleep on a mattress on the floor<br/>- the building is very old. <br/>- the apt is not clean and due to construction it was very noisy. <br/>However. We do appreciate the stay and the location,5,2018-06-06

2595,r:56872516,Jennifer’s place is a wonderful retreat in the middle of the busy city. The bed was super comfy- and the whole space/energy of the place felt very calm and cozy. You can hear some noise in the street (I expected this because you are literally in the heart of the city) but I slept like the proverbial baby every night. Jennifer was kind enough to leave ear plugs in case we needed them but we never did. I definitely recommend her place!,5,2018-10-08

2595,r:165354250,"The apartment met expectations to how it was insinuated on the ad. Jennifer is very welcoming and friendly. A little pricey for a <500 sq ft space, but it is a convenient location. If you don't want to walk up a 4 story stair case after an already long day of walking, this place is not for you.",5,2019-01-02

2595,r:60181725,"I'm glad I stayed here. I liked everything.<br/>The apartment is quite spacious and comfortable with an extraordinary glass roof.<br/>A beautiful reflection of the Empire State Building can be seen in the window.<br/>Excellent location in the center of Manhattan, a few minutes walk to the excellent Bryant Park and to the Whole Foods Market.<br/>Jeniffer is very friendly, on the last day when my flight was delayed  she was not against my late check out. I appreciate it.",5,2019-07-14
2595,r:33952280,"First of all I have to say, that Jennifer is not allowed to sublet her apartment by her landlord. I was instructed by her to not mention airbnb to anybody beforehand, which was fine, but one evening I was stopped by her landlord in the hallway and questioned about where I am staying, how long, where Jennifer is etc. Afterwards, although I didn’t say anything wrong, Jennifer freaked out about it, and I really thought for a few hours that I would have to move out and find another place to stay right away. From that point on I felt really unsafe there and always tried to hide from the landlord. <br/>For my stay the apartment was also not ideal, there is no couch, only cushions on the floor and there is no real table and chairs. I had to work from home sometimes and could not really do it anywhere. <br/>The place was really clean in general, only the bathroom and the shower were really not okay. Especially the shower curtain was mildewed. <br/>The kitchen was clean and well equipped. <br/>Apartment has an AC, which is definitely a pro. <br/>Also, what should be mentioned , the hallway is really narrow and the stairs are quite steep, so with a huge suitcase not ideal, as the apartment is walk-up to the 4th floor.<br/>The location of the apartment is alright, in my opinion it is a bit busy in that area and there are nicer places to live, bit that is just my personal opinion.",5,2019-08-21
2595,r:61580757,"Great location, convenient to everything. Very cool space and building.",5,2019-11-04
2595,r:61404619,"Jennifer's apartment is a well-cared for studio in the heart of midtown Garment District, just a few blocks from Bryant Park. The huge skylight is so nice. The quality of light in the early afternoon is idyllic. It has a casual vibe with sound healing instruments, a bean bag chair, and eclectic decór. The A.C. works great. Jennifer was very friendly and inviting.<br/>Midtown is well-known for its business + tourist vibe. The theatre district is a short walk away. Restaurants are plentiful, though the food is geared towards fast and American. I ate better when I just went for the higher end restaurants, as the quality of the others is questionable. Google reviews of restaurants in the area are inflated. Korea town is a few blocks away and has some better options. Check out Tonchin (best ramen), Fine & Rare (live jazz), and further north, Tao (cavernous Asian Fusion restaurant with a colossal Buddha statue), for unforgettable dining experiences. Culture on 38th is the best coffee shop around.<br/>The apartment has no blackout curtains so expect a good amount of light 24/7. If you're light sensitive like me, this can be a problem. I slept with a sleep mask every night. Thankfully it wasn't noisy at night, other than the occasional garbage truck.<br/>Lastly, something that Jennifer worked valorously to correct, but you should be aware of, is that there is a light odor from the pipes in the bathroom sometimes. The only way to tame the beast is to keep the fan on continuously, otherwise it becomes overwhelming. Hopefully she can get to the root of the problem, and it may be completely fixed soon after I write this review.<br/>Overall, Jennifer's apartment is a unique find that will be a welcome escape from busy, touristy midtown. I especially recommend it for those who are not light- and smell-sensitive, and who like a casual space instilled with positive intentions.",5,2022-06-21
6848,r:18003,"Stayed with Allen and Irina about a year ago. The apartment was more spacious than we thought it would be. They were helpful and nice when we needed that, and left us alone when we needed that too. The location is pretty good, not that far a walk into Williamsburg/hipsterville, and not that far into Manhattan either. We enjoyed our stay!",5,2009-05-25
6848,r:18432,"This apartment was perfect for our stay in NY this past weekend. Very comfortable, easy parking, and very gracious hosts. Thank you so much! I'm sure we'll be back. ",5,2009-06-07
6848,r:8646,"Allen and Irena were simply wonderful hosts and great ambassadors to New York and Brooklyn.   They let us keep our bags in the apartment before check-in and were very easy to communicate with.    They provided us with a map of the area with local stuff like laundry, restaurants, etc.   The apartment itself was very spacious as far as New York goes -- a room that size would normally be hundreds of dollars a night.   Very close to trains and within a mile of Bedford Ave.   Just a really nice place and really nice people.   Thanks so much.  Highly recommended.  ",5,2009-06-14
6848,r:17311,"It's everything Mike M said & more. Allen & Irina are such great people, it felt more like staying with friends than renting a room from strangers. The kitchen has whatever you might need to cook your own meals (but there are too many great places to eat out at that it's a challenge to try to do so). The breakfast goodies provided in the fridge were great & helped us start our day earlier so we could keep exploring. The location was perfect. My friends were skeptical when I said I was staying in Brooklyn to visit NYC, but it was so quick & easy to get to Manhattan every day. I also felt safe coming home late at night. I wouldn't have done anything differently, except book a longer vacation!",5,2009-07-08
6848,r:22786,"The basics: Clean, nice, home-away-from-home feeling.  Safe neighborhood, few-frills but many comforts way to visit NYC. I'd stay here again in a heartbeat.  <br/><br/>Details on my experience: This was my first time using AirBnB, and I thought that it was a great experience.  I've already recommended the site to many friends, and will use it again. My sister's family used it simultaneously, and my brother and I stayed at Allen and Irina's place while she stayed at one of the Hotel Toshi properties.  We were both very happy with our stays, but I think that I got the better deal.<br/><br/>Allen and Irina were *extremely* proactive communicators, confirming dates and arrival times and printing out neighborhood maps with recommended restaurants.  Allen had a parking space right outside the front door, which he gave to me for unloading (my initial spot was 1.5 blocks away - safe, free parking is easily found nearby).  Both were very concerned about making sure we had everything we wanted, and freely offered info, but they never felt intrusive. Helpful, friendly and truly concerned with ensuring we enjoyed ourselves - some of the best customer service ever!<br/><br/>The place itself was really nice. Brooklyn on somewhat of a budget nice, not W hotel nice, but I liked it better than my stay at the Waldorf Astoria several years back. Bigger rooms, fridge and pantry spare but stocked with breakfast essentials, bathroom built for tall people (I'm 6'2"" and my brother is 6'4"" and neither of us had to do the usual ducking for showerheads or sink mirror).  Also, they provided way more clean towels, blankets, etc than we might ever need, and everything looked and felt very clean. Seriously, getting this space at this price was great!<br/><br/>The negatives:<br/>Our last night there, wireless internet went out.  Out of their control, as they lost their residential phone, internet & cable upstairs (as usual, TWC sucks) and they obviously wanted it fixed more than we did.  The TV in the room (as I saw in the photos) was a very small oldschool TV/VCR combo - not a problem for me but perhaps for others.  The apartment is obviously furnished by people rather than by IKEA, which I prefer but some may not like.  <br/><br/>Overall, I'm glad we stayed here rather than one of the Hotel Toshi properties, which have nicer stuff (big flatscreen TV's, ultramodern furnishings) but require dealing with a more corporate machine type of customer service (separate building for check-in, sub-par customer service, maids rushing you to leave so they can clean, etc).  Anyone wishing to contact me for more details is welcome to do so.  Thanks Allen and Irina!",5,2009-07-22

I've lived in Manhattan and wanted to explore Brooklyn and everything that interested me was proximate and easy (and it would have been a breeze to see Manhattan from this location as well.)

I wouldn't bring a date to the room, but there really is nothing that should discourage female travelers from this place. <br/><br/>If you are on business or on vacation I would get a more expensive room but if you are a traveler you will be getting a great value for a secure and private place to sleep.

",5,2009-12-06
12192,r:24501,"To tell the truth - it was  our worst stay ever!<br/><br/>The room's locate in the basement (that was not explained in Edward's descriprion and we were struck on coming there after arriving in NY).<br/>A dusty room of a closet size with a tiny window, through wich one can enjoy an unforgettable landscape of stinky trash cans. Don't believe the view of  Manhattan in one of the pics in the room's description. It's fake.<br/><br/>We made a grave mistake when having booked the room for our entire NY vacation (2 weeks). We could hardly spend there a couple of days - in that stuffy room with bed sheets that seemed not to have been cleaned ever.<br/>The last drop was when Masha got an allergy attack and became covered with rash (though no cases of such strengh had take place earlier).<br/><br/>Se, we were forced to move ASAP.<br/><br/>BUT!! Attention - we lost approximately 300$ on it. The AIRBNB compensated only 50 % of the total sum for the rest days with Edward's(yeah, you won't believe!) and detained their fees. We had to urgently find another place through BNB and pay their fee again (is that fair?).<br/><br/>So, please, be careful with this choice!<br/><br/>P.S.On leaving Edward, we stayed at another place - for the same price - it was excellent!

But the room seemed to be clean (sheets and towels clean).<br/>It was ok for us, because we only stayed there for sleeping. <br/><br/>After a few days, we saw cockroaches in the bathroom, there were more and more until we left.<br/><br/>The worst arrived when I discovered mouse's droppings in our room. After a few days, we saw the mouse in the kitchen, and the last night was really terrible : we didn't sleep at all, hearing the mouse walking in our room, and saw it on our bags...<br/><br/>Edward was in holidays and wasn't there during our 10 days in NY, but was available by email, and was really nice... but that didn't solve anything, the apartment was dirty and we wanted to stay there the less time possible.

We arrived at a time Edward was working, so he couldn't be there to give us the key, but he arranged for us to pick up the key upstairs so we could drop off our stuff. Checking out was easy as well; we could leave our stuff at his place untill we actually left New York.<br/>The room is perfect for when you're staying for a couple of days and just need a place to sleep. The bathroom really reflects it being in a basement (pipe running through the room, a bit rusty and I saw some small bugs), but this was no problem for us. Oh and the towels we're nice and soft! :D",5,2010-10-17
12192,r:254068,"Ed is a great guy - the room is very modest but serviceable.  It also has a lock and key, so you can leave your stuff there.  Keep in mmind that these buildings are rather dated, so this is a basic living arrangement.  The area is really quite cool and has a funky vibe to it - lots of cool cafes and coffee shoppes, lots of young folks with a great chill attitude.",5,2010-10-30

The apartment itself is a small basement unit that gets very little light. But that wasn't an issue since I was barely there during my three nights stay. It was the ideal place for me to drop my stuff off, go out, come back to for sleeping and showering. <br/><br/>I met Edward for a brief time. He was really nice and courteous, much like his cat Joshua, who was very friendly and playful. <br/><br/>All in all, a good and comfortable experience. ",5,2011-01-23

The room is fine, very comfortable bed and we even found there a very interesting guide for New York that we used a lot. <br/><br/>The only DOWNSIDE of the place are the bath and kitchen amenities that you share, which are not always in the best conditions. Since it's a basement and there's lots of humidity, you may find bugs or moisture in both. So be warned if you can't stand bugs or small insects (roaches)... you could be surprised when going to pee at night. If you are OK with this GO ahead and book! ",5,2011-04-15

The room was small and dark, but then again, we were not in NY to stay in the room all the time. We enjoyed the wifi and the tv in the room. <br/>The only remakrs are that the apartment is very dark and could be a little cleaner.<br/>The neighborhood is very nice with lots of nice bars, restaurants and deli's.

It's smaller, but I'd have to describe it more ""cozy"" than I would ""cramped."" Everything was in good order and there were even magazines and cool guide books to seeing the city. I dug it. <br/><br/>As for the host himself, Ed was great. He wasn't intrusive nor was he elusive. Very kind and helpful with suggestions of things to do.  Down to Earth friendly guy. I'm glad it worked out so well. This was my first time ever using Airbnb and I had no idea what to expect. I can only hope that all my future trips work out like this one! ",5,2011-05-13

Located in a vibrant neighborhood of the city, very nice to wander in !<br/>The basement location can feel cramped or such to some people, but really, if you come to visit NyC, you don't want to stay in your room all the time ;-)<br/>Overall, a bargain for the location, a real great value, and Joshua (the cat) is so cuute and friendly !<br/>Highly recommended for a good quality/price ratio !<br/><br/>",5,2011-05-28

6848,r:1645731,"Pros: Pretty nice, clean and spacious apartment in a good area. 3 different subways, all within 5 minutes walk. IMO, this part of Williamsburg is actually better than around the Bedford ave stop, which sometimes feels like a hipster circus. This area is more relaxed but still with lots of good restaurants and bars. And perfectly safe. Well-equipped kitchen. Allen and Irina let us store our bags in their shed after checkout, which was very convenient since we had a couple of hours to kill before our flight. <br/><br/>Cons: The apartment is pretty dark. It's on ground level. You will hear street noises very clearly (this street is surprisingly quiet for NYC though). As far as we could make out, the TV reception was pretty bad, but we didn't come to New York to watch TV so we didn't really try to figure out if it could be made better. <br/><br/>All in all, we had a positive experience. Good value for money. ",5,2013-09-28

We sleep very well.<br/>The best: the space (is huge!), the kitchen (away from the living-bedroom area), the location.<br/>The worst: very dark, forget to be there without AC, TV service (but who needs TV in NYC!).<br/>Is recommendable if you're gonna be in the street all day and just coming back to eat-sleep.",5,2013-10-13

They were really nice and cheery and instantly made us feel welcome. We needn't have brought any guidebooks as the basket on the table had plenty to choose from.<br/><br/>The apartment itself was really nice, it had a lovely homely feel and was surprisingly large, way more than enough room for 2. The bed was amazingly comfortable and the bathroom was great too. Another upside was that the apartment was always lovely and warm whenever we returned from our travels. Unfortunately we didn't get to try out the kitchen beyond using a glass or two (one of the downsides of eating out every night haha) but everything looked in working order.<br/><br/>The location of the apartment was brilliant. In a safe area that's just a walk away from Bedford Avenue and all manner of Restaurants, Cafés, Bars and Delis. There is definitely a lot to do near the apartment.

Edward is very easy to get in contact with, super friendly and a great host.  He offers up everything - towels, NYC books, kitchen, fridge, tea, house keys - that you need to make your trip comfortable.<br/>Although the room is clean, the guest bedroom's window is ground-level on a garbage-filled alley, so if the window/fan is left open, the smell in the room will reflect what is going on outside - one evening we could smell vomit (however, the next day no problems).
